- Fixed: MHQ near ammo box check when placing a satchel was still reporting true even when the MHQ was gone
- Fixed: If gras at start and player can't change gras layer was activated no gras was shown
- Fixed: DeleteMarkerLocal was only allowed to be remotely executed on the server (which makes no sense)
- Fixed: Server localization instead of client localization was used for many markers created on the server
- Fixed: Use "CAN_COLLIDE" for vehicle creation of bonus vehicles to prevent them flying up in the air at creation if there is another vehicle at the same spot
