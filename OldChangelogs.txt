- Added: Angry bots by longtimegamer (has to be turned on)
         There are four new AI settings for allmen and snipers bot behavior:
         - all enemy infantry bots: on an interval, reveal nearby players with "reveal 4" within configurable radius
         - all enemy infantry bots: on an interval, check line-of-sight with players and doSuppressiveFire if LOS or isVisible are true within configurable radius
         - all enemy infantry bots: on an interval, if _fired is true then frequently do "setAmmo 1" (this helps to balance new shooting behavior vs running out of ammo too quickly)
         - all enemy infantry bots which are free to move: on an interval, if bot is a leader then order the group to move to location of nearest player within configurable radius
- Added: Parameter to allow camps to simulate penetration and damage by longtimegamer (d_EnableSimulationCamps)
- Added: Parameter option for very low number of civilian vehicles

4.25

- Changed: Launcher cooldown time is no longer set by launcher class name but is the same for all

             - All camps captured and radio tower destroyed
             - Low number of AI units, all camps captured and radio tower destroyed
             - Low number of AI units and radio tower destroyed
           for "Seize condition for main target:" (d_ao_check_for_ai in description.ext).
           Second one is default (d_ao_check_for_ai = 1)

- Added: Overwatch mode for static infantry in building by longtimegamer

- Changed: Shorter names for some classes in CfgParams (note that you have to check your DB params too; best to recreate them completely)

- Fixed: CUP Winter Chernarus was missing CfgWorlds mapSize field resulting in markers not drawn and wrong bounds for vehicle respawn check (vehicles simply respawned because they were out of bounds)
- Fixed: Engineer spawned FARPs did not use the new txxxservice format resulting in script errors
- Fixed: If a unit classname array had four or less unit classnames it resulted in an array select script error
- Fixed: Independent sniper classname variable was defined as d_sniper_I instead of d_sniper_G which prevented making a normal One Team version against an independent enemy

- Changed: Added even more score messages to the new UI score message system

		 Please note that database dom_params table will always overwrite the settings an admin selects in the lobby :)
- Changed: Switched back from switchMove "AinjPpneMstpSnonWrflDnon" to switchAction "Die" again for players who get killed (and then are uncon). Looks better and smoother than the "oh yeah I have to move to my back" anim.
- Fixed: If just one vehicle of an island patrol group gets stuck and not just the leader vehicle delete and recreate the whole island patrol group
- Fixed: extDB3 1031 and higher now also supported (extDB3 extDB3_var_loaded was changed from a normal boolean to compileFinal which means it is no longer a boolean variable but code now)
- Fixed: Deliver side missions were using normal A3 trucks in third party addon versions like CUP
- Added: New system to create sidemissions with markers only, just place an empty marker and name it like this "d_smm|49|radiotower".
         It will create a destroy radio tower sidemission including inf and armor automatically (compatible with the old system!), nothing more to do!
- Changed: Rep engineer feature (when engineer full is enabled) moved to holdAction (like in revive) instead of normal action and medic animation
- Changed: Switched search body feature from normal action to holdAction

- Changed: Removed main target counterattack (did not add much to gameplay)
- Fixed: Side prisoner mission was completely broken (gamebreaker :/)
- Fixed: Teleport to an additional respawn point always showed the last point instead of the currently selected one (when using more than one additional respawn point)
- and a lot of more (internal) fixes and changes

3.82
- Fixed: A really stupid error between my ears (in other words, cluster bombs dropped by planes should now really no longer destroy a radio tower)
- Fixed: Convtime also for player play time

3.81
ATTENTION: ALTIS Blufor, Carrier, Chernarus and Winter Chernarus versions mission.sqm file was changed!!!!

- Fixed: Convtime function which returned total nonsense results for how long a player played on a server (player top 10, only available when sql database is used)
- Fixed: In the ranked version when a player called CAS score was not removed (player now needs 20 points to call in CAS)
- Fixed: Vehicle service points should now really reload all vehicles correctly again, including aircraft pylons (even when loadout was edited in editor)

- Fixed: Don't draw player name on map if player selects respawn when he/she is unconscious (only start drawing when the player actually has respawned)
- Changed: d_player_ammobox_pos no longer hardcoded, you can add as much as you want by adding a hidden d_player_ammobox_posX marker on the map; ammo boxes will be added automatically
- Changed: Added three FARPs to the Altis Blufor version
- Changed: You can add as many FARPs to the map as you want now (like in the Malden version), just make sure there is a flag with a var name which starts with "d_flag_bb", a marker which starts with d_player_ammobox_pos and a trigger for the service point where the name starts with d_serviceall_trigger
- Changed: Database Top 10 dialog is now much easier to read (finally, still not perfect but at least one can really read it now)
- Fixed: Option to respawn at squad leader should no longer appear if a player is squad leader
- Changed: Removed who is artillery officer, engineer, etc, text boxes from Settings Dialog^(Settings Dialog is WIP)
- Fixed: When setting the group leader in x_revive use the current group and not the one saved at mission start (player might switch group via squad mgmt)
- Changed: Place the flag at base to the initial position, direction and set vector up it again every five minutes (sometimes the map board flips over and lies on the ground)
- Fixed: Player scripting command instead of object reference was used in handleDisconnect which only runs on the server
- Fixed: It was possible to destroy the radio tower with cluster bombs fired from planes because some cluster bomb sub ammunition has simulation shotMine
- Fixed: Headless client unit was not set to playable in the Chernarus and Chernarus Winter version
- and some more internal changes

3.80
- Changed: Replaced a lot of the side mission texts with generic ones (stringtable.xml went down from 708kb to 469kb, easier to translate now)
- Changed: Editor placed boats now also respawn when they get moved more than 50 meters (d_boat_x)

- Fixed: Some other script errors in the moveai script, working fine now again
- Added: Cleanup for ejection seats and canopies
- Fixed: Players were able to use parajump at farps the whole time. Now they have to wait HALO waittime like at the flag at base
- Changed: Show all service point messages for UAVs again if a player is connected to a UAV (otherwise players thought it would not reload weapons)
- Fixed: Reload script (chopper service/vehicle server/plane service) was not working anymore, some turrets were skipped (rewrote that part without recursion)

3.79
- Fixed: Somebody (I think it was me) deleted Malden side mission 31 before 3.78 release :(
- Changed: Farp at Malden version now has also a create ATV action menu entry
- Fixed: When an uncon player pushed a button to respawn at base, MHQ, etc, in the uncon dialog other players could see 3D drawn name before the player body vanished

- Added: Better support for chopper MHQ
- Changed: Replaced MHQ1 in the Carrier and Malden version with an unarmed Hellcat

- Fixed: Additional respawn points did not work at all (d_additional_respawn_points)
- Changed: If SQL database is available and auto save is enabled also save progress to database after sidemission is finished (till now only after main target got cleared)

		 you have to place one Game Master module per player who is allowed to use Zeus with the UID of that player)

- Changed: Reinforcement choppers (for para troopers) now have a waypoint about 1500m behind a main target so that they don't do a full stop over a main target anymore

3.28

- Fixed, player markers are now also shown when a player is in a non standard vehicle like a quad (new marker system is on the way anyway)
- Added one missing drag prone animation
- Changed, vehicles get now airlifted with four ropes instead of one (thanks to the get corners function by duda123), currently only available for normal non wreck lifting

3.27
