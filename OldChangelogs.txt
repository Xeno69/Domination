		 Please note that database dom_params table will always overwrite the settings an admin selects in the lobby :)
- Changed: Switched back from switchMove "AinjPpneMstpSnonWrflDnon" to switchAction "Die" again for players who get killed (and then are uncon). Looks better and smoother than the "oh yeah I have to move to my back" anim.
- Fixed: If just one vehicle of an island patrol group gets stuck and not just the leader vehicle delete and recreate the whole island patrol group
- Fixed: extDB3 1031 and higher now also supported (extDB3 extDB3_var_loaded was changed from a normal boolean to compileFinal which means it is no longer a boolean variable but code now)
- Fixed: Deliver side missions were using normal A3 trucks in third party addon versions like CUP
- Added: New system to create sidemissions with markers only, just place an empty marker and name it like this "d_smm|49|radiotower".

- and a lot of more (internal) fixes and changes

3.82
- Fixed: A really stupid error between my ears (in other words, cluster bombs dropped by planes should now really no longer destroy a radio tower)
- Fixed: Convtime also for player play time

3.81

- Fixed: Vehicle service points should now really reload all vehicles correctly again, including aircraft pylons (even when loadout was edited in editor)

- Changed: Added three FARPs to the Altis Blufor version
- Changed: You can add as many FARPs to the map as you want now (like in the Malden version), just make sure there is a flag with a var name which starts with "d_flag_bb", a marker which starts with d_player_ammobox_pos and a trigger for the service point where the name starts with d_serviceall_trigger
- Changed: Database Top 10 dialog is now much easier to read (finally, still not perfect but at least one can really read it now)
- Fixed: Option to respawn at squad leader should no longer appear if a player is squad leader
- Changed: Removed who is artillery officer, engineer, etc, text boxes from Settings Dialog^(Settings Dialog is WIP)
- Fixed: When setting the group leader in x_revive use the current group and not the one saved at mission start (player might switch group via squad mgmt)
- Changed: Place the flag at base to the initial position, direction and set vector up it again every five minutes (sometimes the map board flips over and lies on the ground)
- Fixed: Player scripting command instead of object reference was used in handleDisconnect which only runs on the server
- Fixed: It was possible to destroy the radio tower with cluster bombs fired from planes because some cluster bomb sub ammunition has simulation shotMine
- Fixed: Headless client unit was not set to playable in the Chernarus and Chernarus Winter version
- and some more internal changes

- Changed: Replaced a lot of the side mission texts with generic ones (stringtable.xml went down from 708kb to 469kb, easier to translate now)

3.50
ATTENTION: Tanoa TT version mission.sqm file has changed!

- Addded: Parameter to disable fog when the internal weather system is on
- Fixed: Some blufor markers did not get deleted for the opfor side in the Tanoa TT version (wrong marker names in mission.sqm file)

3.49

- Fixed: Ofpor arty operator did not see artillery messages in the TT version
- Fixed: Oponent team in the TT version did see specific artillery messages of the other team (like artillery available again in a few minutes)
- Fixed: Opening the artillery dialog as a blufor player blocked opening the artillery dialog for opfor players too
- Fixed: When the independent AI enemy side in the TT version took a camp from blufor again the flag turned red instead of green (a little bit confusing that was)
- Changed: Enabled parajump flags at main targets in the TT version
- Fixed: Some kbTell messages were broadcasted globally instead of just for one side in the TT version

3.47

3.46
ATTENTION: Altis TT version mission.sqm file has changed!

- Fixed: Wrong points for Captain in the TT version (were the same as for Seargeant). Resulted in an endless loop between getting promoted to Seargent and Captain

- Changed: Reduced mass of heavy vehicles for chopper lifting even more
- Changed: Parajump wait time at base removed from 30 minutes to 0 (time between two jumps from base)

3.43

- Fixed: Vehicle creation should not result in vehicles falling over anymore

- Fixed: Stupid typo in server\x_f\fn_airtaxiserver.sqf (underline got lost)

- Changed: disableRemoteSensors true on clients in ai version too (for testing purposes)
- Fixed: NVG check for players was broken

3.32
- Fixed: Counter attack was using wrong function to find enemy start positions
- Changed: Counter attack starts earlier now (45-90 seconds instead of 120-240 seconds after main target is clear), check trigger for end condition gets also created a lot earlier now

- Fixed: BIS_fnc_EGSpectator changes viewdistance. When BIS_fnc_EGSpectator exits viewdistance is set to the one before BIS_fnc_EGSpectator was started (BIS_fnc_EGSpectator is admin only)
- Optimized: Using getInMan (and getOutMan) eventhandler now for vehicle scripts instead of the typical waituntil {vehicle player != player} script construct

3.28
- Fixed: If you want to change an element of an array use set and not setVariable (error in fn_p_o_ar, me dumb)
- Changed, reset player in vehicle variable after respawn. Possible fix for ammoload problem (stops working after respawn if player is in a vehicle when he dies)
- Fixed, player markers are now also shown when a player is in a non standard vehicle like a quad (new marker system is on the way anyway)
- Added one missing drag prone animation
- Changed, vehicles get now airlifted with four ropes instead of one (thanks to the get corners function by duda123), currently only available for normal non wreck lifting

3.27

- Changed CfgRemoteExec mode to 2-turned on, however, ignoring whitelists (default because of backward compatibility) There was a bis_fnc_execVM warning in RPT although Dom is not using bis_fnc_execVM
- Vehicle overlay alignment corrected
- Switched to enhanced BI task system
- Fixed UI serialisation
- Fixed various small bugs
