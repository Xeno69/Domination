		 Please note that database dom_params table will always overwrite the settings an admin selects in the lobby :)
- Changed: Switched back from switchMove "AinjPpneMstpSnonWrflDnon" to switchAction "Die" again for players who get killed (and then are uncon). Looks better and smoother than the "oh yeah I have to move to my back" anim.
- Fixed: If just one vehicle of an island patrol group gets stuck and not just the leader vehicle delete and recreate the whole island patrol group
- Fixed: extDB3 1031 and higher now also supported (extDB3 extDB3_var_loaded was changed from a normal boolean to compileFinal which means it is no longer a boolean variable but code now)
- Fixed: Deliver side missions were using normal A3 trucks in third party addon versions like CUP
- Added: New system to create sidemissions with markers only, just place an empty marker and name it like this "d_smm|49|radiotower".
         It will create a destroy radio tower sidemission including inf and armor automatically (compatible with the old system!), nothing more to do!
- Changed: Rep engineer feature (when engineer full is enabled) moved to holdAction (like in revive) instead of normal action and medic animation
- Changed: Switched search body feature from normal action to holdAction

- Changed: Removed main target counterattack (did not add much to gameplay)
- Fixed: Side prisoner mission was completely broken (gamebreaker :/)
- Fixed: Teleport to an additional respawn point always showed the last point instead of the currently selected one (when using more than one additional respawn point)
- and a lot of more (internal) fixes and changes

3.82
- Fixed: A really stupid error between my ears (in other words, cluster bombs dropped by planes should now really no longer destroy a radio tower)
- Fixed: Convtime also for player play time

3.81
ATTENTION: ALTIS Blufor, Carrier, Chernarus and Winter Chernarus versions mission.sqm file was changed!!!!

- Fixed: Convtime function which returned total nonsense results for how long a player played on a server (player top 10, only available when sql database is used)
- Fixed: In the ranked version when a player called CAS score was not removed (player now needs 20 points to call in CAS)
- Fixed: Vehicle service points should now really reload all vehicles correctly again, including aircraft pylons (even when loadout was edited in editor)
- Changed: Routine to draw 3D text for service points, etc, simplified (no longer hardcoded)
- Fixed: Check for Malden version was wrong, returned true when it was not the Malden version
- Fixed: Don't draw player name on map if player selects respawn when he/she is unconscious (only start drawing when the player actually has respawned)
- Changed: d_player_ammobox_pos no longer hardcoded, you can add as much as you want by adding a hidden d_player_ammobox_posX marker on the map; ammo boxes will be added automatically
- Changed: Added three FARPs to the Altis Blufor version
- Changed: You can add as many FARPs to the map as you want now (like in the Malden version), just make sure there is a flag with a var name which starts with "d_flag_bb", a marker which starts with d_player_ammobox_pos and a trigger for the service point where the name starts with d_serviceall_trigger
- Changed: Database Top 10 dialog is now much easier to read (finally, still not perfect but at least one can really read it now)
- Fixed: Option to respawn at squad leader should no longer appear if a player is squad leader
- Changed: Removed who is artillery officer, engineer, etc, text boxes from Settings Dialog^(Settings Dialog is WIP)
- Fixed: When setting the group leader in x_revive use the current group and not the one saved at mission start (player might switch group via squad mgmt)
- Changed: Place the flag at base to the initial position, direction and set vector up it again every five minutes (sometimes the map board flips over and lies on the ground)
- Fixed: Player scripting command instead of object reference was used in handleDisconnect which only runs on the server
- Fixed: It was possible to destroy the radio tower with cluster bombs fired from planes because some cluster bomb sub ammunition has simulation shotMine

		 you have to place one Game Master module per player who is allowed to use Zeus with the UID of that player)

ATTENTION: Tanoa TT version mission.sqm file has changed!

- Addded: Parameter to disable fog when the internal weather system is on

- Fixed: Ofpor arty operator did not see artillery messages in the TT version
- Fixed: Oponent team in the TT version did see specific artillery messages of the other team (like artillery available again in a few minutes)

3.46

- Fixed: Vehicle creation should not result in vehicles falling over anymore

- Fixed: Stupid typo in server\x_f\fn_airtaxiserver.sqf (underline got lost)

- Changed: disableRemoteSensors true on clients in ai version too (for testing purposes)
- Fixed: NVG check for players was broken

3.32
- Fixed: Counter attack was using wrong function to find enemy start positions
- Changed: Counter attack starts earlier now (45-90 seconds instead of 120-240 seconds after main target is clear), check trigger for end condition gets also created a lot earlier now

- Fixed: BIS_fnc_EGSpectator changes viewdistance. When BIS_fnc_EGSpectator exits viewdistance is set to the one before BIS_fnc_EGSpectator was started (BIS_fnc_EGSpectator is admin only)
- Optimized: Using getInMan (and getOutMan) eventhandler now for vehicle scripts instead of the typical waituntil {vehicle player != player} script construct

3.28
- Fixed: If you want to change an element of an array use set and not setVariable (error in fn_p_o_ar, me dumb)
- Changed, reset player in vehicle variable after respawn. Possible fix for ammoload problem (stops working after respawn if player is in a vehicle when he dies)
- Fixed, player markers are now also shown when a player is in a non standard vehicle like a quad (new marker system is on the way anyway)
- Added one missing drag prone animation
- Changed, vehicles get now airlifted with four ropes instead of one (thanks to the get corners function by duda123), currently only available for normal non wreck lifting

3.27

- Changed CfgRemoteExec mode to 2-turned on, however, ignoring whitelists (default because of backward compatibility) There was a bis_fnc_execVM warning in RPT although Dom is not using bis_fnc_execVM
- Vehicle overlay alignment corrected
- Switched to enhanced BI task system
- Fixed UI serialisation
- Fixed various small bugs
