ATTENTION: extDB3 domination-custom.ini file has changed. You need to copy the one from the download file @extDB3\sql_custom folder to your server @extDB3\sql_custom folder

ATTENTION2: mode was set to 1 in description.ext CfgRemoteExec Functions and Commands. That means only script commands and functions defined in CfgRemoteExec are allowed to be executed remotely now. Set to 2 to disable it if it causes issues

- Added: In params "With AI recruitment" you can now select "Yes, but AI may not enter static weapons" (description.ext d_with_ai value 2)
- Changed: CfgRemoteExec functions and commands mode is set to 1 (only whitelisted functions/commands are allowed for remote execution) in description.ext now; please note that it might block scripting commands and functions used in addons/mods
- Changed: Show the number of votes a main target got as number beside the marker
- Changed: Bigger parajump dialog
- Fixed: Number of player teamkills did not get added correctly to the SQL database
- Fixed: If with AI recruitment is enabled you can now use additional addons which create AI on the player side without the mission deleting them
- Optimized: Only broadcast the last global marker command over the network and not all
